####What's in this repository?

The repository contains four main folders:

* curriculum
* logistics
* publicity
* scripts

In curriculum, you will find three folders.  __handouts__ contains copies of handouts to 
print for student use.  __presentations__ contains .odp files used at events.  __diffpatchdemo__ contains materials used in the diff_patch_demo activity.

In logistics, you will find two folders.  __schedules__ contains copies of schedules to 
print for student use.  __mentors__ contains a draft of guidelines/handouts to give to mentors who'll
be attending events.

In publicity, you will find one folder.  __flyers__ contains copies (mostly editable) of publicity
flyers made for past events.  You are welcome to edit and re-use them.

In scripts, you will find scripts for generating the publicity website.  The context for using this
script can be found [here](https://openhatch.org/wiki/Open_Source_Comes_to_Campus/Practicing_Git/Organizer).

The repository contains a fair amount of obsolete material.  It may be difficult to find the most 
relevant and up to date stuff - for help doing so, please contact us.
