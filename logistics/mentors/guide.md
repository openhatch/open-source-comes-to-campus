# How to help - a guide for mentors at OSCTC events

Hi!  Thank you so much for volunteering to help at our Open Source Comes to Campus event!

You may be wondering what, specifically, we're expecting of you and what you can do to prepare.  This guide goes over everything that's involved in being an Open Source Comes to Campus mentor.

## <a name="activities">Activities</a>

### <a name="practicing_git">Practicing Git</a>

Practicing Git is a hands-on activity to help students learn how to use Github/Git/version control.  Organizers will ask mentors ahead of time about their comfort with Git, and assign mentors to work with advanced students, regular students, or to float.

If you are asked to lead a group for the git activity, please read [this page](https://openhatch.org/wiki/Open_Source_Comes_to_Campus/Practicing_Git/Instructors) to familiarize yourself.  You should also send your github username to the organizer.

### <a name="career_panel">Career Panel</a>

Most events have a career panel where students can ask questions about mentors' experiences in open source.  If you have, or have ever had, an open source job, you can be on the panel.

There's zero preparation you need to do, but if you'd like to see how we structure the panel or some of the questions you might be asked, you can do so [here](https://openhatch.org/wiki/Open_Source_Comes_to_Campus/Curriculum/Career_Panel).

### <a name="contributions_workshop">Contributions Workshop</a>

The contributions workshop is the last part of the day.  Over time, we've come to believe that the most important thing we can do for students is to help them build an ongoing relationship with an open source project - not simply fix a bug or land a patch.  (Though it's awesome when they do!)  Accordingly, we're working to identify great projects for beginners with clear documentation, enthusiastic maintainers, and a bunch of approachable tasks.  The contributions workshop introduces students to those projects.

We've found that the best way to engage students is to provide them with clear structure and a lot of guidance.  But we also understand that students might not be interested in that structure.  We talk about what to do when that happens in the "other options for students" section below.

#### <a name="overview">Overview of Workshop</a>

Before the event, we'll identify and prepare [open source projects]() for students to work on in groups.  Which projects are selected will depend in part on the interests, experiences and skills of the mentors we have at the events.  We'll ask you about those and match you up with an open source project.  (Do you maintain an open source project?  Are you interested in helping students contribute to it?  If so, the open source project you're matched with could be your own.)

All projects will be assigned a mentor at the event.  Often, this "local mentor" will not be a contributor to the project.  In this case, they'll be matched up with a "remote mentor", who will be a maintainer of the project.  The two mentors will work together to introduce students to the project.  Occasionally, a local mentor will have an open source project they maintain.  In this case, there would be no remote mentor.

At the beginning of projects time, there will be a brief presentation on each of the projects.  Students will then go sit with the local mentor leading that project, where they will learn about the project in more detail.  Each project will have several tasks for students to work on.  Students can choose whether to work on a task alone or with others, but they will always be surrounded by others working on the general project and will have access to an in-person mentor familiar with their task.

Throughout projects time, mentors will help students communicate with their remote mentor, document their progress, and take steps into the community (joining IRC channels, leaving comments on issues, joining mailing lists, etc).  At the end of the workshop, there will be a wrap up where students and mentors talk about what they did.  Accomplishments like joining a mailing list or reporting a bug should be emphasized and celebrated as much as getting a patch merged.

#### <a name="specific_responsibilities">Specific Responsibilities</a>

To help you get ready for the contributions workshop, we'll go into more detail about the responsibilities of mentors below.

##### Before the Event

Projects need to be prepared for each event.  Although much of the work of checking development environment setup and creating good documentation should be already taken care of, there are a few additional things that need to be done.  (If you are a local mentor who wants students to contribute to your project, the setup work may _not_ be done.  We will help you with that!)

###### For in-person mentors

- When asked, provide feedback to organizers about your interests, experiences and skills so we can match you with a project.  If there is a specific project on our list you would like to be a mentor for, say so.
- Once you've been assigned to a project, go through the installation and contribution guides.  Give feedback to the remote mentor if anything is buggy or confusing.
- (Optional) Look through the tasks that have been chosen for the event.  Are the tasks clear?  Do they provide all the information a student would need?  Could you complete the task using this information?  Give feedback to the remote mentor as needed.

###### For remote mentors

- Go through your project and identify tasks for students to work on at the event.  You may find [this section of our guide](http://opensource-events.com/#defining-tasks-for-attendees) useful in doing so.
- Respond to feedback from local mentor re: your setup/contribution guides, as well as your identified tasks.

##### At the event

The local and remote mentor are a team.  The remote mentor is more familiar with the group's project, and should be able to provide clarification, feedback and insight when debugging.  The local mentor is able to see students as they work, and will be better able to notice signs of frustration, disengagement, or confusion.  The two mentors should be comfortable enough with each other that the local mentor can easily say, "Why don't you ask [remote mentor] about that in IRC?" or "Why don't you ask [local mentor] to show you that on your computer?"

###### For in-person mentors

- Respond as best as you can to questions and comments from students.  If you can't answer a question, direct students to the remote mentor on IRC.
- Help students document their progress via [bug reports]().
- Keep an eye on students and approach them if they seem bored, frustrated, or otherwise disengaged (see [Approaching Students](#approaching_students)).  If they don't want to work on the project, direct them to [other options for students](#other_options).

###### For remote mentors

- At the start of the contributions period, give a detailed explanation of your project to the group of students who will be working with you.
- Respond as best as you can to question and comments from students in IRC.
- Give feedback to pull requests and other proposed changes.  If possible, merge changes once you're satisfied with them.

##### After the event

Although we recognize that not every attendee will be immediately transformed into an impassioned open source activist, we'd like to try to follow up with each student.  To do this, we request the following from our mentors:

###### For in-person mentors

- Make sure the [bug reports]() you had students fill out make their way to the organizers.
- Pass along [notes]() on student experiences to organizers as well.

###### For remote mentors

- Try to merge any pull requests from the event within 48 hours.  For requests that can't be merged as-is, provide feedback.
- Go through the [bug reports]() provided by students and local mentors and add missing information. 
- Welcome and work with any attendees who continue to engage with your project.

#### <a name="other_options">Other Options for Students</a>

There are a couple other options for students who don't want to work on one of the projects we've provided.  These options include: 

The [Finding a Project handout](), which guides students through the process of finding and evaluating open source projects.  It can be done in pairs, with a mentor, or by oneself.

If a student has a project they want to work on, the can sit down with a floating mentor or other attendee and go through the steps of joining an open source project.  It may be more difficult for them to get a development environment set up, find tasks to work on, etc but some students will enjoy this more anyway.

Sometimes students will just want to do their own thing.  Let them do it.  :)

## <a name="approaching_students">Approaching Students</a>

Open Source Comes to Campus is very activity focused, which means that you'll frequently find yourself in the presence of a whole bunch of students attempting to join IRC for the first time, or understand a bug report, or use git, or fix a problem with a project.  These students won't always ask for help when they need it, so it's important that you feel comfortable approaching and engaging them.  This section has been written to help with that.

There are a few basic principles that should guide your interactions with attendees.  We'll go over those first, and then we'll give you some practical advice.

### <a name="principles">Principles</a>

* __Everything is a learning experience__.  We believe that there's always something to learn, for mentors as well as students.  If you don't know the answer to an attendee's question, tell them so - and show them how to go about finding the answer.  When a student gets stuck, don't just fix their problems for them - explain what the problem is and guide them through the solution.  Open Source Comes to Campus is an ever-improving project, so when a student has a problem with the event itself or any of our activities or tools, encourage them to [make an issue](https://github.com/openhatch/open-source-comes-to-campus/issues) out of it. 

* __Approach everyone__.  Every attendee should have at least a few good interactions with mentors at the event.  (Unless the student clearly doesn't want to interact - see "Autonomy of Students" below.)  While you should prioritize helping students who are struggling, it's also important to spend time with students who are thriving.  It can also be hard to tell when a student is struggling, so approaching everyone means you won't miss helping those who tend not to ask for help.

* __Autonomy of students__.  We do our best to create a great workshop experience, but in the end it's every attendee's choice how much they want to engage.  Don't pressure a student to do an activity they're not interested in or learn in a way they don't want to learn.  (Some people learn best entirely on their own, and won't want your help no matter how badly they're stuck!)  Do try to engage students, and offer them alternatives if they don't like an activity, but if that doesn't work, respect their decision and move on to helping another attendee. 

### <a name="practical_advice">Practical Advice</a>

#### <a name="struggling">Signs Someone Is Struggling</a>

* Facial expressions that read as frustrated, sad, angry, confused, bored, etc.  If you have difficulty identifying facial expressions and/or body language, try [this resource]().

* Raised hand or other attempt to flag down a mentor.

* Looking around the room or generally not engaged with computer or handouts.

* The screen of their laptop does not display what it should, during a computer activity.  Person is doing nothing with their hands, during a hands-on activity.

* The person is contesting the activity itself: "it's not useful", "it's not what I am here for". Refusal might be in fact a sign of struggling with the purpose and path of the activity.

#### <a name="questions">Questions to Ask Students</a>

_If a student looks like they are struggling_:

* How's it going?
* Where are you at in the exercise?
* Running into any snags?
* Would you mind telling me what you've done so far?

_If a student does not look like they are struggling_:

* How's it going?
* Where are you at in the exercise?
* What's your plan for the next step?
* How did you complete the last step?
* Can you explain {concept from the activity} to me?

_During socializing periods (like lunch)_:

* How's it going?  (Yes, this works for everything.)
* How'd you find out about this event?
* What classes are you taking?/Have you picked a major yet?
* Do you use any open source projects?
* Are you interested in getting more involved?  Do you have any hesitations?  (This frequently leads to discussions about topics like finding the free time, finding good projects, etc.)

#### <a name="common_problems">Common Problems</a>

__Assuming fault for failure.__

The problem:  When students have difficulty understanding an activity or contributing to a project, they often will assume it's due to their own ignorance/lack of experience/lack of ability.  Because they're not as familiar with the obstacles open source presents, they can't identify what's going wrong - just that something is.  They may assume it's entirely their fault and get discouraged.

The solution:  Talk through the issue and reframe it as a lack of information, not a lack of ability.  (Perhaps the project's guidelines aren't clear enough.  Perhaps the student hasn't been taught a particular tool or concept yet.)  Relate a story, if you have one, about your own difficulties doing a similar thing.  Talk with the student about how they'd tackle a similar problem if they face it in the future.

__Failing silently.__

The problem:  Students will sometimes run into issues with activities or with open source projects they're contributing to, and just quietly give up/move on to something else.

The solution:  Emphasize the importance of feedback.  Open source projects have elaborate systems set up to elicit, record, and respond to feedback: issue trackers, mailing lists, etc.  Encourage students to use the [Open Source Comes to Campus issue tracker](https://github.com/openhatch/open-source-comes-to-campus/issues) where appropriate, and to give feedback to project maintainers via IRC, mailing lists, and issue trackers.  If you have a story in which a bug report or more informal feedback helped you solve a problem, share it.

__Having difficulty setting up a development environment.__

The problem:  Students can't complete an activity or contribute to a project because they're having trouble setting up the development environment.

The solution:  This can be a tricky one for a mentor to address if they're not familiar with a given project's requirements.  If you are familiar - or you're an old hand at debugging this sort of thing - great!  Just make sure to show the student what you're doing and explain the steps you're taking.  If you're not, you can role model lifelong learning by asking other people at the event (or on IRC) for help.  There should be at least one person available at the event or on IRC who is especially good at handling environment setup, and you'll be told ahead of time who those people are. 

__Having difficulty finding a project.__

The problem:  Despite sincere interest in open source, students frequently will have difficulty choosing a specific project to work on.  This is common enough that we've actually redesigned our curriculum to make it less of an issue.

The solution:  You can see the [Contributions Workshop section](#contributions_workshop) for more details about guiding students through their first contributions.  More generally, though, approaches to finding good projects include asking:
* Are there any open source projects you already use?
* Do you have any friends or connections to an open source project?
* What kind of contributions do you want to make?  (If programming, what language(s)?)

__Coming into the event late.__

The problem: If they're late, they're probably behind.

The solution: Talk with them briefly about what they already know.  (They may not need to catch up on git, for instance, if they've used it before.)  If they need to catch up on one or more skills, direct them to [this website](), which contains the contents of a typical Open Source Comes to Campus event written for a student to guide themselves through.  Direct the student to that page and periodically check up with them.  If possible, get them started with IRC right away so that they can ask questions into chat.

### <a name="final_notes">Final Notes</a>

A few last things to be aware of...

Don't assume that an attendee knows something, no matter how commonplace or obvious it seems to you.  For example, I used to open up documents in nano (my command line editor of choice) without explaining what I was doing.  This confused a significant number of people - frequently people who were familiar with the command line and/or text editors, but had never heard of nano.  Finally one of them asked me what was going on.  Now I explain the first time I use a command line text editor to open a file. 

Relatedly, even if a tool or concept seems fundamental to you, don't show surprise or make a big deal out of it when a student hasn't heard of it.  Our attendees come from all backgrounds, including non-CS ones.  And regardless of background, everyone has a first time they hear about something.  Make that experience affirming and enjoyable, not embarrassing.

Avoid grabbing the keyboard.  If at all possible, walk someone through their problem verbally.  If you really need to type to figure something out, we recommend you open a text editor on your own computer, set the font to be enormous, and type on your own computer. If somehow you must type on the student's computer, ask first and be careful to not be invasive about the other person's physical space if they do give permission.
